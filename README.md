### What is Ausbit?

Ausbit is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Ausbit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Ausbit Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Ausbit Core software, see http://ausbit.com/#download, or read the
[original whitepaper](http://ausbit.com/?page_id=6091).

### ausbit done right

This is the Android port of the ausbitwallet iOS app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ausbit/ausbitwallet-ios/).

##### a completely standalone ausbit wallet:

Unlike many other ausbit wallets, ausbitwallet is a real standalone ausbit
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.ausbit.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, ausbitwallet connects directly to the ausbit network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

##### the next step in wallet security:

ausbitwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, ausbitwallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets.

##### beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is ausbitwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because ausbitwallet is  
[deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.
